geostatsistics and spatial statistics, with maps of course.
This will contain (eventually) the spatial R code and data that I use in teaching at The University of Western Australia, in these units:
<ul>
<li>ENVT3361 Environmental Assessment</li>
<li>ENVT5503 Soil and Groundwater Remediation</li>
<li>SCIEM504 Data Analysis with R for Agricultural & Environmental Science</li>
</ul>
